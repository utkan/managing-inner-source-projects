# Introduction

It was 2011 when Marc Andreessen wrote his famous article, “Why Software
is eating the World”[^1]. By that time, Linux Kernel was already 20
years old, developed under an open collaborative model by hundreds of
developers from different companies, and some even contributing during
their spare time. Linux can be found in almost any kind of device, from
IoT and car components, to super computing cloud hardware, without
forgetting one of the most used mobile operating systems in the market.

And Linux is just one example of how a free, open source software (OSS)
project has evolved from one single idea in one single person’s head to
multiple applications in many different fields and sectors. Each
application has improved it over time, thanks to its open collaborative
development methodology.

Almost 6 years later, we can assure that free, open source software
(OSS) projects have succeed in the IT development ecosystem. We can see
companies adopting OSS technologies and people contributing to OSS from
different companies and even during their spare time.

How has OSS reached the level of innovation we have nowadays? How has it
reached the market acceptance we see nowadays? How has it engaged so many
people and organizations to contribute to it?

It’s a teamwork effort and quoting John Wooden (former UCLA Bruins
basketball coach) in IBM Linux comercial [^2]:

“A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player.
Losing yourself in the group for the good of the group, that’s
teamwork.”

Since the collaboration methodologies used in OSS projects are providing
high quality innovative technology thanks to engaged development communities, 
why not applying same methodologies inside your company? That's InnerSource!

If you haven't decided yet to apply InnerSource in your company, we recommend you
start reading "Getting Started with InnerSource"[^3] by Andy Oran. After that, or if
you have already decided to start the InnerSource path, this book will give you better
understanding of InnerSource scenarios, framework and management skills.

## InnerSource principles

InnerSource software development takes its principles from the open source software 
development culture. Jim Jagielski, from The Apache Software Foundation, has listed 
them[^4] as:

1. Culture
2. Communication
3. Transparency
4. Collaboration
5. Community
6. Meritocracy

As an organization willing to adopt InnerSource methodology, the first step is to look
how close are organization's principles with these open source ecosystem principles, and 
work on minimizing the *deltas* with them.
